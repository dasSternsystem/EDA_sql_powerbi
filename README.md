First, the database has been developed in order that Hotel Booking Data could be analized and visualized. After that, we have done exploartory data analysis with SQL, conected the database to PowerBI and have made the dashboard, with the goal to answer these questions:
Is our hotel revenue growing by year? 
Should we increase our parking lot size?
What trends can we see in the data?
